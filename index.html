                <h4>A text based game wherein the player has been struck with extremely bad luck on their
                    first day of school. </h4>

                    <h3>Plot:</h3>
                    <p>Waking up feeling a little strange, you find yourself being hit by extremely bad luck.
                        It must have been something to do with that weird dream of yours... Anyway, you get
                        up from the wrong side of the bed (literally and figuratively) and have to make it
                        through the day. </p>

                    <p>As the day goes on you will be forced to pick between more and more options for some
                        strange scenarios with only one allowing you to continue on with your day. If you pick
                        one of the bad options, it will be Groundhog Day. </p>

                    <p>There will be a total of 10 scenarios with each one seemingly as harmless as the others.
                        Check your score in the leaderboards to see if you finished the game in the least amount
                        of tries! </p>
